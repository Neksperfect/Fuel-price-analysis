Exploratory analysis of fuel prices in Nigeria (2021–2024)
# ⛽ Fuel Price Analysis in Nigeria (2021–2024)

Welcome to one of the most pressing questions in Nigeria’s economy:

**Why do fuel prices keep rising — and what’s really behind them?**

This project dives deep into 2+ years of Nigerian fuel pricing data to understand the forces shaping what we pay at the pump — including inflation, global oil prices, and the aftermath of subsidy removal.

## What This Project Covers

- 📈 National fuel price trends before and after the **June 2023 subsidy removal**
- 💰 Correlation between **fuel prices and inflation (CPI)**
- 🌍 Comparison with **Brent Crude oil prices** to test if global markets drive local prices
- 🗺️ Regional disparities — which states pay the most (and why)
- 🧠 Real fuel price (adjusted for inflation) vs. nominal pump price

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 🚨 Fuel prices surged **over 200%** in just 2 years.

- 📊 Strong correlation with **CPI (r = 0.91)** — fuel is a top inflation driver in Nigeria.

- 🛢️ Surprisingly **weak (even negative)** correlation with **Brent crude** — meaning our fuel prices follow local forces more than global ones.

## ✨ What You’ll Learn

- How to clean and structure real-world economic data
- How to integrate multiple data sources: local + global
- How to interpret time-series & correlation trends
- How to visualize policy effects (e.g., subsidy removal) using data
